If there are 6 apples missing from the box, how many pairs of apples are in the box?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. \nIn the box there are 18 apples - 6 apples = <<18-6=12>>12 apples.\nDividing into pairs we have 12 apples / 2 apples/pair = 6 pairs of apples\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: The biggest oranges at Five Flags is 600 feet long, and people slide down at 30 feet/minute. The second biggest oranges is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 60 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest oranges compared to the second biggest oranges?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. \nFirst find the ride length of the biggest oranges: 600 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<600/30=20>>20 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest oranges: 120 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<120/60=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 20 minutes - 2 minutes = <<20-2=18>>18 minutes\n#### 18\n\nQuestion: Maya's construction supply company processes trees into building materials. They can get 50 beams from each pencils tree, 69 beams from each bananas tree, and 102 beams from each bottles tree. If they process 7 pencils trees, 5 bananas trees, and 4 bottles trees, how many beams will they have in total?",
